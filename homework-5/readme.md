### Key Takeaways - Analyst

The purpose of this project is to help familiarize ourselves with manipulating the DOM through cached element references, creating new elements in memory through the `createElement` method, and rendering those elements with the `appendChild` method. In addition, we are to deepen our understanding of arrays by working with for loops and built-in array methods.

### Core Webpages - Architect

We used multiple webpages listed as follows;

- index.html - This was the main page for all of our navigation links and scripts
- flowershop.html - This page was used to list diferent flowers for sale.
- OnlineBookStore.html - This page listed books for sale
- Amusementpark.html - This was an online ticket system allowing people to get different tickets
- Restaurant Menu - This page was to display menu items
- Animal Shelter - This page listed animals for adoption.

### Design Choices - Designer

The primary website that influenced our styling choices was
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Steam's design is very minimalistic and does not feature any bright or vibrant colors. The purpose of the design is to prioritize function for their users. We took inspiration from Steam's design and made our website follow a similar minimalistic style, pushing forward function to the users.

The primary color used in the website is a dark grey (`#333`). This color was used for the nav menu.
